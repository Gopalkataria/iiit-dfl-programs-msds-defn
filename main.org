   programme.  This table will be made available on the
   programme's website and on the programme's LMS.

* Programme Overview

The Master of Science in Data Science (Online) (abbreviated
MSDS in this document) is a programme designed to prepare
the student for a career in Data Science.  The programme
demands commitment from the student but also offers
considerable flexibility in terms of self-pacing, i.e.,
planning to complete course activities at their own pace
instead of being dictated by a fixed pace.

#+name: tbl-overview
#+caption: Programme Overview
|-----------------------+-------------------|
|-----------------------+-------------------|

|-----------------------+-------------------|
| Informal Abbreviation | MSDS              |

|-----------------------+-------------------|
| Duration              | upto 4 years      |
|-----------------------+-------------------|

The first aspect of the flexibility is exhibited in Table
[[tbl-overview]], where the duration of the programme is four
years, which is twice the duration of a normal Masters
programme in India.  The extra two years are a way of
accommodating the self-paced approach to acquiring the
degree that a student may wish to choose.

* Admission, Cohorts and Profile

   - Who can apply :: Anyone with a Bachelors degree in
     Science, Technology or Engineering.

   - Prerequisites :: The applicant needs to have
     completed a basic course in programming (preferably
     Python) and also one or more courses in undergraduate
     mathematics that cover elements of calculus, linear
     algebra and probability theory.

   - Elibility does not imply admission :: Note that
     eligibility alone is insufficient to guarantee
     admission to the programme.  The final decision on
     admissions is made by the admissions committee of the
     Centre for Distance and Online Education, Division of
     Flexible Learning, IIIT Hyderabad.

   - Admission as Cohorts :: Admission to the programme
     is done periodically.  Students are admitted in batches
     called cohorts.  Students in a cohort share some common
     resources like a discussion group.  However, in future,
     it is possible that admissions are kept open and
     rolling, so the student need not belong to a cohort.

 - Student Identification and Profile :: A student will be
   assigned a roll-number at the time of admission.  The
   email address given at the time of admission will also be
   used to uniquely identify a student and it will be used
   for all official communication with the student.
     
* Program Registration and Fee payment

 - Admission to a Programme :: A student is admitted to
   the entire programme, not an individual course, a degree
   or a diploma.

 - Registration and Fees :: A student registers for a set
   of courses by paying the fees /prevailing at the time of/
   registration.  Courses may be registered in sets of four,
   eight or all sixteen.

 - Open Registration :: A student can register for a set of
   courses any time of the year.  The courses will be made
   available to the student on the LMS only according to the
   \hyperlink{nom-sched}{nominal schedule} of the cohort to
   which the student belongs.  Students are encouraged to
   register well in advance of the start date of a term so
   that they can benefit from aligning with a
   \hyperlink{nom-sched}{nominal schedule}.


* Structure of the Programme
** Courses,  terms and weeks
A /course/ is a collection of academic activities undertaken
by a student with the goal of learning demonstrated by the
earning of credits.  A /term/ is a temporal interval over
which the course activities are carried out.  Two terms
together form a /semester/.

The MSDS programme consists of 16 courses.  Each course's
artefacts and activities are planned over a term.  A term
lasts 13 weeks.  

** Temporal Flexibility: Nominally paced vs. Self-paced

One of the salient features of the MSDS programme is the
flexibility it offers to students who wish to complete
courses at their own pace.  A distinction is to be made
between /nominally-paced/ and /self-paced/ schedules.  A
nominally paced schedule or a
\hypertarget{nom-sched}{nominal schedule} is an ideal
schedule which assumes that a student completes a course (an
academic entity) within a term.

This is shown in Table [[tbl-weeks]].

#+name: tbl-weeks
#+caption:  Week-wise breakup of a nominally paced schedule for a course.
|------------+---------------------|
|------------+---------------------|
| Week       | Type                |
|------------+---------------------|
| Weeks 1-11 | Instructional Weeks |
|------------+---------------------|
| Week 12    | Preparation Week    |
|------------+---------------------|
| Week 13    | Exam Week           |
|------------+---------------------|


On the other hand, a student may complete the course
according to their own schedule subject to some very broad
constraints, which are specified later in this document.
For example, a student may decide to skip the final exam
during the 13th week and instead opt to take the exam when
it is offered again at a later date.   

** Improvement Flexbility

The programme allows the student to improve their
performance in a course by allowing re-submission of graded
assignments and re-taking of final exams.  In most cases,
this would be done by the student to pass the minimum-score
requirements for assignments, final exam and overall score
in the course.  In other occasions, the student may choose
to improve their score even though their scores meet the
minimum pass requirement.

** Weekly effort per course

The activities and estimated student effort in a course week
and over the duration of the course is taken at nominal pace
is listed in Table [[tbl-effort]].  These estimates may vary
slightly across courses.

* Programme Calendar, Events, Booking 

The calendar of the programme is set to a nominal schedule.
The calendar is populated by events, which are summarised in
Table [[tbl-events]]:

** Events and Tickets

To facilitate flexibility, the MSDS programme permits (under
certain conditions) to either re-schedule or re-attempt
certain types of events.  This is implemented through
tickets and a ticket-booking protocol.

*** Initial tickets
For each course, a student is given an initial set of
tickets: 11 assignment submission tickets, 11 tutorial
tickets, and 1 final exam ticket.  

*** Mapping a ticket to an event
A ticket is booked for an event.  The assignment submission
is not tied to any date.  The exam ticket and the tutorial
tickets are tied to the date on the nominal schedule.  

*** Cashing in on a ticket
A ticket may be consumed or cashed when the student either
makes an assignment submission, attends a live tutorial
session, or takes a final exam.  

*** Rescheduling a booking
A student may choose to reschedule a booking to a later
date.  For assignment submissions, there is no notion of
rescheduling.  Submissions can be made anytime.  For final
exams and tutorials , a booking may be rescheduled up to a
week in advance of the event date.  If slots are not
available, the booking may be denied and the student will
then need to look to book for a future date when that event
will repeat.  

*** Assignment tickets
For each course, the student is initially given 11 homework
tickets.  The student may submit an assignment any time
during the programme calendar.  Each submission consumes one
ticket.  If a student wishes to re-submit a homework and is
left with no more tickets, they may do so by purchasing an
extra ticket.  

*** Ticket expires if no-show
If a student has a booking for an exam or tutorial event,
and the student does not attend the event, then that ticket
is considered consumed or expired.

*** Booking extra tickets
It is possible that a student wishes to resubmit an
assignment or re-take an exam.  In that case, the student
may book an extra ticket.  A ticket may be booked any number
of times.  Booking an extra ticket is accompanied by a fee.


Table [[tbl-tix]] summarises the ticket booking policy.

* Certificate, Diploma and Degree

1. When a student completes completes a course, the  student
   earns the number of credits associated with the course. 

2. To earn an MSc. DS degree, the 16 courses need to be
   completed within 4 years from the date of enrollment into
   the programme.
   
3. The student earns a Diploma in Data Science by completing
   the courses 1-8.

* Evaluation and Grading

The graded components of the course are graded assignments
and the final exam.  To complete and course, a student
needs to score the minimum scores for each component given
in Table [[tbl-min-scores]].

#+name: tbl-min-scores
#+caption:  Minimum percentage scores on assignments (all combined)  and final exam
|------------+---------------+---------|
|------------+---------------+---------|
| Type       | Minimum score | Remarks |
|------------+---------------+---------|
| Assignment |           50% | Overall |
|------------+---------------+---------|
| Final Exam |           40% |         |
|------------+---------------+---------|

A weighted sum of the overall score in the graded
assignments component and the score in the final exam
component is taken to to arrive at the student's final score
in the course.  The relative weights for the two components
are shown in Table [[tbl-weights]].
#+name: tbl-weights
#+caption:  Relative weights of assignments and final exam to compute the course score
|-------------+--------|
| Activity    | Weight |
|-------------+--------|
| Assignments |    30% |
|-------------+--------|
| Final Exam  |    70% |
|-------------+--------|

The final (absolute) score obtained by the student in the
course is mapped to a letter grade and a grade point.  The
final Cumulative Grade Point Average is calculated in the
standard way by taking the weighted ($w_i$) sum of the grade
point ($p_i$) in each course $i$ of the program.

\[ G = \sum_{i} p_i w_i\]

* Completing a course 
** Minimum Engagement in a course

A student completes a course by engaging in all the
activities that are part of the course.  The student's
engagement in the course will be monitored.  The minimum
engagement necessary to complete a course is summarised in
Table [[tbl-min-effort]].

** Prerequisite for taking an exam 

Courses have prerequisites.  A student may take the final
exam of a course only after have completing all the
prerequisite courses.  Note that the condition applies only
to taking the final exam, not registering or participating
in the course.

** Re-attempts

It is quite possible that a student takes a course and
during the course, either fails to meet the minimum score
for assignments or an exam.   In such an event, the student
may resubmit the assignment or retake the exam.

There are fees associated with re-attempts which will be
charged at the time of registering a re-attempt.  The
prevailing fees are available in a separate document.

* Academic Dishonesty

** What constitutes Academic Dishonesty

Engaging in academic dishonesty includes but is not limited
to the following:

  1. Copying from another student as part of an assignment,
     exam, quiz or test.
  2. Copying and pasting from the internet or a GenAI tool as part of an assignment,
     exam, quiz or test.
  3. Using unauthorised material during an exam, quiz or test.
  4. Seeking help from an unauthorised person or a device
     like a mobile phone during the process of an exam, test or quiz.
  5. Collusion: Collaborating with another person as
     part of an assignment, exam, quiz, or test.
  6. Plagiarism: Submitting work not created by oneself as
     one's own.

** Penalties for Academic Dishonesty

The penalties associated with academic dishonesty are listed
in Table [[tbl-penalties]].
